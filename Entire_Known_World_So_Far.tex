\ParallelLText{\noindent
What's meant to be wind emerges from what's \\
presumably a god's mouth, as if people \\
thought that way, once, as I have read they did, \\
though I have never believed it. Yes, \\
the stag inexplicably there, on a raft \\
at sea, how the light catches in the runneled \\
fur of a dog's underpaws as he steers \\
across dream; yes, the gods and their \\
signs, if you want, everywhere -- 

\-\ \\but the wind is the wind. the map makes \\
the world seem like a human body \\
when it's been stripped and you can finally \\
see it for the world it is: plunderable -- 

\-\ \\ almost, in places, as if asking for it --} 

\ParallelRText{\noindent
who wouldn't want to lay waste to it \\
the map suggests, suggest the hands \\
that made the map, with the kind of \\
grace that proves grace can \\
be a sturdiness, too.

\indent \indent \indent But the world is \emph{not} like a human body \\
\indent \indent \indent Or the dark that, just past twilight, \\
\indent overtakes a canyon.

\-\ \\ \indent \indent \indent Or the shiver of sleigh bells on the collar \\
\indent \indent \indent of an invisible donkey, scratching itself \\
\indent \indent \indent in the dark, \\
\indent \indent \indent in the cold of it --

\-\ \\ \indent \indent \indent \indent \indent \indent \indent \indent donkey bells...
