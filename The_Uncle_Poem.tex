\begin{paracol}{3} % this is what I want
avuncular\\
trees\\
or was it avuncular skyscrapers?\\
yea it was the skyscrapers but\\
I don’t know man\\
I remember it was tuesday\\
the cars were doing their\\
normal car shit some asshole\\
was blasting Puccini\\
out of his BMW and some other\\
asshole was singing\\
an opera as he walked\\
down Main Street\\
what else\\
I saw my grandmother\\
this wasn’t anything crazy tho\\
she’s still alive and all that\\
she lives in town she was\\
driving her convertible\\
very slow I waved at her but\\
I’m not sure she recognized me\\
no other family interactions to report\\
\switchcolumn[1]
something about the day unsettled me tho\\
in the worst way possible\\
I knew I would be going home soon \\ %End of 1st column 
home to the hills where\\
hill things happen\\
but I had thrown that terror into the future\\
like a baseball or a bag of trash\\
and of course it is the future now but I’m not\\
in the hills not yet\\
so why were the skyscrapers\\
avuncular to me\\
me who had many uncles none\\
of whom were skyscrapers\\
I think I have a few less uncles\\
now but it’s hard to keep track\\
big family and you know what\\
they say uncles are like crab apples they wither\\
maybe it was that it\\
smelled like crab apples\\
while I walked down Main Street\\
\switchcolumn[2]
I don’t know where\\
that quote comes from probably\\
someone famous but I remember my uncle\\
saying it and it seems like a quote\\
about your uncles dying but that uncle\\
wasn’t dying not yet he was\\
very much alive and very much\\
addicted to oxycodone\\
but the consequences would be\\
far in the future but I guess\\
the future is now which means\\
the consequences have already happened\\
which makes perfect sense\\
because that uncle died\\
tho not of overdosing exactly he died\\
of a heart attack induced by fireworks\\
on the fourth of July one of three\\
citizens to do so in the county that day I\\
do not know what made hearts\\
so angry on that particular fourth it was warm\\
but when wasn’t it\\
