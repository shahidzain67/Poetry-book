\begin{paracol}{3} % this is what I want
avuncular\\
trees\\
or was it avuncular skyscrapers?\\
yea it was the skyscrapers but\\
I don’t know man\\
I remember it was tuesday\\
the cars were doing their\\
normal car shit some asshole\\
was blasting Puccini\\
out of his BMW and some other\\
asshole was singing\\
an opera as he walked\\
down Main Street\\
what else\\
I saw my grandmother\\
this wasn’t anything crazy tho\\
she’s still alive and all that\\
she lives in town she was\\
driving her convertible\\
very slow I waved at her but\\
I’m not sure she recognized me\\
no other family interactions to report\\
something about the day unsettled me tho\\
in the worst way possible\\
I knew I would be going home soon \\ %End of 1st column 
would be impossible because he is dead and\\
altho it doesn’t mean his pills are gone\\
it does mean it would be super
uncool to break into his trailer\\
and steal them I have\\
determined that he is the uncle I am referring to when I said\\
the skyscrapers were avuncular\\
tho referring isn’t the right word\\
I didn’t intend to call them avuncular\\
I felt it and it wouldn’t go away\\
like a dog bite\\
but what made the skyscrapers\\
so avuncular my uncle had never been\\
to the city and possibly had never been\\
to any city he was country from his hair to the tip\\
\switchcolumn[1]
home to the hills where\\
hill things happen\\
but I had thrown that terror into the future\\
like a baseball or a bag of trash\\
and of course it is the future now but I’m not\\
in the hills not yet\\
so why were the skyscrapers\\
avuncular to me\\
me who had many uncles none\\
of whom were skyscrapers\\
I think I have a few less uncles\\
now but it’s hard to keep track\\
big family and you know what\\
they say uncles are like crab apples they wither\\
maybe it was that it\\
smelled like crab apples\\
while I walked down Main Street\\
I don’t know where\\
that quote comes from probably\\
someone famous but I remember my uncle\\
saying it and it seems like a quote\\
about your uncles dying but that uncle\\
wasn’t dying not yet he was\\
of each toe he was so country that his countryness stretched\\ %
out from his body and into his car\\
maybe it’s because he never\\
saw these skyscrapers that I\\
think of him tho that\\
is bullshit and I know it so why the fuck\\
could I not push the avuncular\\
skyscrapers out of my decidedly\\
non-avuncular brain\\
was it the windows? the\\
black paneling?\\
maybe it isn’t the building at all\\
maybe it’s the idea of the building\\
and tho I don’t believe in ideas\\
I do believe in uncles\\
maybe it is that the building
\switchcolumn[2]
very much alive and very much\\
addicted to oxycodone\\
but the consequences would be\\
far in the future but I guess\\
the future is now which means\\
the consequences have already happened\\
which makes perfect sense\\
because that uncle died\\
tho not of overdosing exactly he died\\
of a heart attack induced by fireworks\\
on the fourth of July one of three\\
citizens to do so in the county that day I\\
do not know what made hearts\\
so angry on that particular fourth it was warm\\
but when wasn’t it\\
warm in the valley I wasn’t\\
there when my uncle died I\\
had picked up overtime\\
at the call center because\\
I needed money to buy\\ % End of second column
some oxycodone\\
for myself\\
I was planning to buy it\\
off of him tho obviously that\\
is so high it would take minutes to elevator up\\ %End of 3rd
and maybe an hour to climb\\
which means by the top you would be in\\
the future the real future the future minutes\\
away not seconds a future farther than\\
a word is from another word and maybe\\
because I look\\
at the skyscraper from the top down\\
I think of those elevators in reverse\\
which means I think of the future in reverse\\
and if those elevators go enough\\
the future will reverse enough to be the past\\
like the real past\\
like a few months ago when my\\
uncle was breathing and taking\\
pills and feeling the high\\
come on like television static\\
turning into tv or like tv\\
turning into television static
