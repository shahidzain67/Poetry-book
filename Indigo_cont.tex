\ParallelLText{\noindent
in the back of my mind thoughts of You cascade down like waterfalls\\
as water falls against glass\\
and drops from my lash\\
becomes streams on my cheeks\\
and puddles in my palms\\
for the celestial being You are\\
\hspace{9mm} I give alms to Him\\
and pray that I receive ilm forthright\\
and on that night become Your generations’ protector\\
and hear the voice of God saying\\
“Protect Her as I protect you”\\
\hspace{9mm} “Sanctify Her so that men may see My Love through you”\\
\hspace{9mm} “And Wali, believe”\\
\hspace{9mm} “My voice Kanika has already told you to just breathe”\\
so as long as I have breath\\
\hspace{9mm} Love I will never leave\\
I understand that many men may have said things like this before\\
but from now until the last beat of my heart\\
every night I’ll walk through Your door saying\\
\hspace{9mm} Baby\\
\hspace{18mm} I’m home}
