\ParallelLText{\noindent
Standing between the door and the mirror, I can see\\
at multiple angles, my grandmother and the other shoppers,\\
all of them decent and goodhearted women, diligent\\
in cleanliness, grooming, and decorum\\
Even now my grandmother, not to be rushed,\\
is delicately drying her pumps with tissues from her purse\\
For my grandmother always wears well-turned pumps\\
that match her purse, I think in case someone\\
from one of the best families of Aleppo\\
should run into herâ€”here, in front of the Kenmore display}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
I smile at the midwestern women\\
as if my grandmother has just said something lovely about them\\
and shrug at my grandmother as if they\\
had just apologized through me\\
No one is fooled, but I\\
\\hold the door open for everyone\\
and we all emerge on the sales floor\\
and lose ourselves in the great common ground\\
of housewares on markdown.}
