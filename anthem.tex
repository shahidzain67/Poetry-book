What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?\\
\hspace{4mm} — Only the monstrous anger of the guns.\\
\hspace{4mm} Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle\\
Can patter out their hasty orisons.\\
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; \\
\hspace{4mm} Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,—\\
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;\\
\hspace{4mm} And bugles calling for them from sad shires.\\
\\
What candles may be held to speed them all?\\
\hspace{4mm} Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes\\
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.\\
\hspace{4mm} The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;\\
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,\\
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
