And this I dreamt, and this I dream,\\
And some time this I will dream again,\\
And all will be repeated, all be re-embodied,\\
You will dream everything I have seen in dream.\\
\-\ \\
To one side from ourselves, to one side from the world\\
Wave follows wave to break on the shore,\\
On each wave is a star, a person, a bird,\\
Dreams, reality, death - on wave after wave.\\
\-\ \\
No need for a date: I was, I am, and I will be,\\
Life is a wonder of wonders, and to wonder\\
I dedicate myself, on my knees, like an orphan,\\
Alone - among mirrors - fenced in by reflections:\\
Cities and seas, iridescent, intensified.\\
A mother in tears takes a child on her lap.\\
