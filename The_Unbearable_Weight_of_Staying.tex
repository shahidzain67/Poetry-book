i donâ€™t know when love became elusive\\
what i know, is that no one i know has it\\
my fathers arms around my mothers neck\\
fruit too ripe to eat, a door half way open\\
when your name is a just a hand i can never hold\\
everything i have ever believed in, becomes magic.\\
\-\ \\
i think of lovers as trees, growing to and\\
from one another searching for the same light,\\
my mothers laughter in a dark room,\\
a photograph greying under my touch,\\
this is all i know how to do, carry loss around until\\
i begin to resemble every bad memory,\\
every terrible fear,\\
every nightmare anyone has ever had.\\
\-\ \\
i ask did you ever love me?\\
you say of course, of course so quickly\\
that you sound like someone else\\
i ask are you made of steel? are you made of iron?\\
you cry on the phone, my stomach hurts\\
\-\ \\
i let you leave, i need someone who knows how to stay.
