I can’t explain where\\ 
all my love for you\\
came from\\
it’s as if we once \\
raised a child\\
baby fingers gripping pinkies\\
or died together on\\
a bed of dandelions\\
it’s as if I were the moon\\
and you were the sun\\
always convincing each other\\
the next day was worth rising for\\
and when I was too caught\\
up in being the ocean you\\
never forgot to remind me\\
what your earth felt like.\\ 
i don’t know if we’ll finally\\
collide in this century,\\
but I am certain I have\\
loved you in more than\\
\emph{a thousand different lifetimes.}
