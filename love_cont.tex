We drank to forget the problem.\\
We inhaled the problem, exhaled the problem, crushed its ember under our shoe.\\
We put a title on the problem, took out all the articles, conjunctions, and verbs. Called it\\
\hspace{0.3cm} “Exprmntl Prblm.”\\
We shot the problem, and put it out of its misery.\\
We swallowed daily pills for the problem, followed a problem fast, drank problem tea.\\
We read daily problem horoscopes. Had our problem palms read by a seer.\\
We prayed.\\
Burned problem incense.\\
Formed a problem task force. Got a problem degree. Got on the problem tenure track. Got a\\
\hspace{0.3cm} problem retirement plan.\\
We gutted and renovated the problem. We joined the Neighborhood Problem Development Corp.\\
We listened and communicated with the problem, only to find out that it had gone for the day.\\
We mutually empowered the problem.\\
We kissed and stroked the problem, we fucked the problem all night. Woke up to an empty bed.\\
We watched carefully for the problem, but our flashlight died.\\
We had dreams of the problem. In which we could no longer recognize ourselves.\\
We reformed. We transformed. Turned over a new leaf. Turned a corner, found ourselves near a\\
\hspace{0.3cm} scent that somehow reminded us of the problem,\\
In ways we could never\\
Put into words. That\\
Little I-can’t-explain-it\\
That makes it hard to think. That\\
Rings like a siren inside.
