\begin{tabular}{l}
here is a country where old men\\
gather in the capital and\\
speak their language filled with\\
stones\\
their syllables are chips of bone\\
they speak of lifting up a creed\\
while cold and still there under\\
their tongue is somebody else's child\\
or mine\\
bones and stones\\
our ears bleed\\
red and white and blue\\
