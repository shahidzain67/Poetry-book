Isn't the moon dark too,\\
most of the time?\\
\\
And doesn't the white page\\
seem unfinished\\
\\
without the dark stain\\
of alphabets?\\
\\
When God demanded light,\\
he didn't banish darkness.\\
\\
Instead he invented\\
ebony and crows\\
\\
and that small mole\\
on your left cheekbone.\\
\\
Or did you mean to ask\\
"Why are you sad so often?"\\
\\
Ask the moon.\\
Ask what it has witnessed.
