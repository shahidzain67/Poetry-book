\& while I wait for my eyes to relearn open \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] myself \hspace{3mm} for the slow rise\\ 
the deep ache in the crane of my neck \hspace{3mm} \hspace{3mm} from bowing down inside myself \\
I [forgive] the surrender the swollen knee \hspace{3mm} the bruise on my rib \hspace{3mm} shape \& shade\\ of an August sunrise \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] the fence \hspace{3mm} I could swear was the horizon \hspace{3mm} or at least\\

\-\ \\ a way out \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] myself for imagining \hspace{3mm} a way out is a place I could visit\\ like a corner café or ex-lover’s thigh \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] myself for loving\\
those who have harmed me \hspace{3mm} for cooking them dinner \& burning the rice \hspace{3mm} forgetting\\ to add pepper or make myself a plate \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] myself for staying \hspace{3mm} I [forgive]\\

\-\ \\ myself for staying \hspace{3mm} until I left my skin \hspace{3mm} another blanket on the bed \hspace{3mm} until the sound\\ 
of a door opening \hspace{3mm} turned each room into a reason to leave \hspace{3mm} I counted each second\\
alone as a tiny victory \hspace{3mm} until I lost count \hspace{3mm} which is the only victory that matters\\ please let healing be not a season \hspace{3mm} but the body that still belongs to me \hspace{3mm} \& every day\\

\-\ \\ I remember to buy bread \hspace{3mm} to hide the keys \hspace{3mm} beneath the window succulent\\ 
or walk along the road dreaming of anything other than traffic \hspace{3mm} is a day I get closer\\
to a future made better by how I live through it \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] myself for failing\\ 
today \hspace{3mm} for falling back into bed \& drawing the blinds \hspace{3mm} give me time\\

\-\ \\ I’ll get up I promise \hspace{3mm} I know it doesn’t matter where I go \hspace{3mm} every direction is forward\\ 
I just have to get there \hspace{3mm} I take a step \hspace{3mm} \& step naked into the shower \hspace{3mm} the water\\
so cold I forget to breathe \hspace{3mm} my body yearns to follow the pearls \hspace{3mm} falling through\\ the metal grate to become not quite a ghost \hspace{3mm} but a shadow just out of frame \hspace{3mm} I say no\\
I [forgive] \hspace{3mm} I [forgive] myself \hspace{3mm} with my body right in front of me
