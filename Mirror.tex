\begin{tabular}{l}
\& while I wait for my eyes to relearn open \indent I [forgive] myself \indent for the slow rise the deep ache in \\
the crane of my neck \indent \indent from bowing down inside myself \\
I [forgive] the surrender the swollen knee \indent the bruise on my rib \indent shape \& shade of an August \\ 
sunrise \indent I [forgive] the fence \indent I could swear was the horizon \indent or at least\\

\-\ \\ a way out \indent I [forgive] myself for imagining \indent a way out is a place I could visit like a corner café\\
or ex-lover’s thigh \indent I [forgive] myself for loving\\
those who have harmed me \indent for cooking them dinner \& burning the rice \indent forgetting to add pepper\\
or make myself a plate \indent I [forgive] myself for staying \indent I [forgive]\\

\-\ \\ myself for staying \indent until I left my skin \indent another blanket on the bed \indent until the sound of a door\\
opening \indent turned each room into a reason to leave \indent I counted each second\\
alone as a tiny victory \indent until I lost count \indent which is the only victory that matters please let healing\\
be not a season \indent but the body that still belongs to me \indent \& every day\\

\-\ \\ I remember to buy bread \indent to hide the keys \indent beneath the window succulent or walk along the road\\
dreaming of anything other than traffic \indent is a day I get closer\\
to a future made better by how I live through it \indent I [forgive] myself for failing today \indent for falling back\\
into bed \& drawing the blinds \indent give me time\\

\-\ \\ I’ll get up I promise \indent I know it doesn’t matter where I go \indent every direction is forward I just have to get\\
there \indent I take a step \indent \& step naked into the shower \indent the water\\
so cold I forget to breathe \indent my body yearns to follow the pearls \indent falling through the metal grate\\
to become not quite a ghost \indent but a shadow just out of frame \indent I say no\\
I [forgive] \indent I [forgive] myself \indent with my body right in front of me
