That time\\

I thought I could not\\
go any closer to grief\\
without dying\\
I went closer,\\
and I did not die.\\
Surely God\\
had His hands in this,\\
as well as friends.\\
Still, I was bent\\
and my laughter,\\
as the poet said,\\
was nowhere to be found.\\
Then said my friend Daniel\\
(brave even among lions),\\
“It’s not the weight you carry\\
but how you carry it –\\
books, bricks, grief –}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
it’s all in the way\\
you embrace it, balance it, carry it\\
when you cannot and would not,\\
put it down.”\\
So I went practicing.\\
Have you noticed?\\
Have you heard\\
the laughter\\
that comes, now and again,\\
out of my startled mouth?\\
How I linger\\
to admire, admire, admire\\
the things of this world\\
that are kind, and maybe\\
also troubled –\\
roses in the wind,\\
the sea geese on the steep waves,\\
a love\\
to which there is no reply?}
