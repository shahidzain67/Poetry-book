    \emph{Q. How do others sin against you?}\\
    \emph{A. By cursing me—telling lies about me—or striking me.}\\
    \emph{Q. What must you do to those who thus sin against you?}\\
    \emph{A. I must forgive them}\\
    
    \-\ \\See, I learned my catechism well.\\
    Learned to offer my cloak and coat, my cheek\\
    again and again as the skin was splayed\\
    from my body. I can quote\\
    Martin Luther King Jr. with ease,\\
    praise the Americana of his martyrdom,\\
    the sweet, unselfish beauty of that bullet’s velocity.\\
    Shall I sing “We Shall Overcome” while\\
    I swing? I have wanted so long\\
    to believe in justice, to think of each blow\\
    as recompense for my wickedness.\\
    How can I continue?\\
    How can I continue?\\
    How can I continue\\
    to take and eat this image\\
    of myself, choke on the eloquence\\
    of my dissent, speak love fluently\\
    to someone with his knee\\
    on my neck, his bullet in my child?
