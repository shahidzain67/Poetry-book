As soon as you begin to ask the question, Who loves me?\\
you are completely screwed, because\\
the next question is How Much?\\
\\and then it is hundreds of hours later,\\
and you are still hunched over\\
your flowcharts and abacus,\\
\\trying to decide if you have gotten enough.\\
This is the loneliest job in the world:\\
to be an accountant of the heart.\\
\\It is late at night. You are by yourself,\\
and all around you, you can hear\\
the sounds of people moving\\
\\in and out of love,\\
pushing the turnstiles, putting\\
their coins in the slots,\\
\\paying the price which is asked,\\
which constantly changes.\\
No one knows why.\\
\emph{Always.}
