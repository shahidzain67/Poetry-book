\ParallelLText{\noindent
I will wake you up early\\
even though I know you like to stay through the credits.\\
\-\ \\ I will leave pennies in your pockets,\\
postage stamps of superheroes\\
in between the pages of your books,\\
sugar packets on your kitchen counter.\\
I will Hansel and Gretel you home.\\
\-\ \\ I talk through movies.\\
Even ones I have never seen before.\\
\-\ \\ I will love you with too many commas,\\
but never any asterisks.\\
\-\ \\ There will be more sweat than you are used to.\\
More skin.\\
More words than are necessary.}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
My hair in the shower drain,\\
my smell on your sweaters,\\
bobby pins all over the window sills.\\
\-\ \\ I make the best sandwiches you’ve ever tasted.\\
You’ll be in charge of napkins.\\
\-\ \\ I can’t do a pull-up.\\
But I’m great at excuses.\\
\-\ \\ I count broken umbrellas after every thunderstorm,\\
and I fall asleep repeating the words thank you.\\
\-\ \\ I will wake you up early\\
with my heavy heartbeat.\\
You will say, \emph{Can’t we just sleep in}, and I will say,\\
\emph{No, trust me. You don’t want to miss a thing.}}
