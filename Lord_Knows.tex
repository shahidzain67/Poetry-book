\ParallelLText{\noindent
It gets messy underneath the veil\\
when the strength it takes to be\\
can zap the moisture from your skin,\\
and all you want is to be held to the\\
breast of a beautiful being and never let go\\
while the beautiful people sing,\\
I hope your new soul remains pure!\\
And lord knows what we lose\\
once we believe we are clean, how purity\\
breeds atrocity like terriers in heat,\\
why, like a flock of pigeons circling\\
a rooftop, lord, we know not why we do.\\
And lord knows weâ€™re heavy with\\
the weight of time, and that too many\\
times, we died before we began,\\
that every prayer is a vanity, every\\
god oblivious to our cries.}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
What else now but to speak plainly:\\
\emph{Lord, we curse this devilful motherfucker to the\\
ground. Let us march on cities until they\\
crumble, blasting} Miles Smiles \emph{as loud\\
as the speakers will bear, to tell them\\
how even in that moment,\\
which would feel to them so dark and \\unrelenting,\\
there could be infinite beauty\\
if they would allow themselves to feel it.}}
