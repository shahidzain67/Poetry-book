Dear dirt, I am sorry I slighted you,\\
I thought that you were only the background\\
for the leading characters—the plants\\
and animals and human animals.\\
It’s as if I had loved only the stars\\
and not the sky which gave them space\\
in which to shine. Subtle, various,\\
sensitive, you are the skin of our terrain,\\
you’re our democracy. When I understood\\
I had never honored you as a living\\
equal, I was ashamed of myself,\\
as if I had not recognized\\
a character who looked so different from me,\\
but now I can see us all, made of the\\
same basic materials—\\
cousins of that first exploding from nothing—\\
in our intricate equation together. O dirt,\\
help us find ways to serve your life,\\
you who have brought us forth, and fed us,\\
and who at the end will take us in\\
and rotate with us, and wobble, and orbit.
