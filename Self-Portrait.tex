\ParallelLText{\noindent
i believe that sometimes \indent \indent we do not die\\
\-\ \\ i will not believe that to be housed in a body\\
that is black \indent is to be dressed always\\
in black for the funeral \indent \indent we live forever\\
\-\ \\ our mouths open \& a song falls out \indent thick\\
with a saxophone’s syrup \indent \indent \& all our dead\\
in the ground make this land ours \indent \indent \& all\\
our missing fathers make us everything’s child\\
\-\ \\ today i did not dress for a funeral \indent today i wear\\
the yellow dress \indent \& laugh with all my teeth\\
today my lost ones are not lost to me \indent they live\\
in the wind that gathers my skirt\\
\-\ \\ today this is my country \indent today i say their names\\
\& the all holes left behind \indent \indent shaped like blackgirls\\
\& blackboys \indent are lit up by hundreds of faraway stars}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
today i woke up \& was not dead \indent \& tomorrow\\
might be different but tomorrow \indent does not yet exist\\
so i hold my mother’s hand \& kiss \indent \indent the brown valley\\
between each knuckle \indent my brother opens his mouth\\
to laugh \& the light pours in \indent through the gap in his teeth\\
\& no one will ever again say my eyes are too serious\\
\-\ \\ i press my body to a man that i find beautiful \indent \& sway\\
to a song that knows us \indent \indent i live forever\\
with my feet in my grandmother’s lap\\
\-\ \\\& \indent \indent  \indent \indent i live forever by the water\\
with the sun spilled over me \indent remember me this way\\
\& when they come for me \indent \indent play the song i love\\
into the space i leave behind}
