\ParallelLText{\noindent
I know who I am\\
I am here now\\
but I may be gone in an instant\\
even if I am no longer here I am me, myself\\
but in truth I do not have to be me\\
\-\ \\I am a plant at least a little\\
I may be a fish more or less\\
I am also an ore with a dull sheen\\
though I don't know its name\\
\-\ \\and of course I am almost you\\
\-\ \\Because I cannot disappear after being forgotten\\
I am a rhythm in a refrain\\
I am a subtle wave and a particle\\
having arrived, if I may be so conceited,\\
riding on your heart's beating rhythm\\
from the light years of distance}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
I know who I am\\
\-\ \\so I know who you are\\
even if I don't know your name\\
even if there is no census record\\
I am crowding out into you\\
\-\ \\Feeling happy being wet in rain\\
feeling at home with the starry sky\\
cackling at crude jokes\\
I am me\\
beyond the tautology of "I am me"}
