May we raise children\\
who love the unloved\\
things–the dandelion, the\\
worms and spiderlings.\\
Children who sense\\
the rose needs the thorn\\

\\\& run into rainswept days\\
the same way they\\
turn towards sun…\\

\\And when they’re grown \&\\
someone has to speak for those\\
who have no voice\\

\\may they draw upon that\\
wilder bond, those days of\\
tending tender things\\

\\and be the ones.
