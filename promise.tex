Stay, I said\\
to the cut flowers.\\
They bowed\\
their heads lower.\\
\\Stay, I said to the spider,\\
who fled.\\
\\Stay, leaf.\\
It reddened,\\
embarrassed for me and itself.\\
\\Stay, I said to my body.\\
It sat as a dog does,\\
obedient for a moment,\\
soon starting to tremble.\\
\\Stay, to the earth\\
of riverine valley meadows,\\
of fossiled escarpments,\\
of limestone and sandstone.\\
It looked back\\
with a changing expression, in silence.\\
\\Stay, I said to my loves.\\
Each answered,\\
\emph{Always.}
