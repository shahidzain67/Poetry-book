\ParallelLText{\noindent
Tyger! Tyger! burning bright,\\
In the forests of the night,\\
What immortal hand or eye\\
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\
\-\ \\In what distant deeps or skies\\
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?\\
On what wings dare he aspire?\\
What the hand dare seize the fire?\\
\-\ \\And what shoulder, \& what art,\\
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?\\
And when thy heart began to beat,\\
What dread hand? \& what dread feet?}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
What the hammer? what the chain?\\
In what furnace was thy brain?\\
What the anvil? what dread grasp\\
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?\\
\-\ \\When the stars threw down their spears,\\
And watered heaven with their tears,\\
Did he smile his work to see?\\
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\\
\-\ \\Tyger! Tyger! burning bright\\
In the forests of the night,\\
What immortal hand or eye\\
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?}
