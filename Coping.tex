It has rained for five days\\
running\\
the world is\\
a round puddle\\
of sunless water\\
where small islands\\
are only beginning\\
to cope\\
a young boy\\
in my garden\\
is bailing out water\\
from his flower patch\\
when I ask him why\\
he tells me\\
young seeds that have not seen sun\\
forget\\
and drown easily
