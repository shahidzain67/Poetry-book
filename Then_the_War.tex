\ParallelLText{\noindent
They planted flowers because the house had many rooms\\
and because they’d imagined a life in which\\
cut flowers punctuate each room, as if each were a sentence\\
\-\ \\not just to be decorated but to be given some discipline,\\
what the most memorable sentences—like people—always\\
slightly resist... Spit of land; rags\\
\-\ \\of cloud-rack. Meanwhile,\\
hawk’s-nest, winter-nest, stamina as a form of faith, little\\
cove that a life equals, what they meant, I think, by\\
\-\ \\what they called the soul, twilight taking hold\\
deep in the marshweed, in the pachysandra, where the wind\\
can’t reach.}

\ParallelRText{\noindent 
Then the war.\\
Then the field, and the mounted police\\
parading their proud-looking horses across it.\\
\-\ \\Then the next morning’s fog, the groundsmen barely visible\\
inside it, shadow-like, shade-like,\\
grooming the field back to immaculateness.\\
\-\ \\Then the curtains billowing out from the lightless room\\
toward the sea.\\
Then the one without hair\\
\-\ \\stroked the one who had some. They closed their eyes.\\
If gently, hard to say how gently.\\
Then the war was nothing that still bewildered them, if it ever had.}
