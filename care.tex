\begin{tabular}{l}
When I am dead and over me bright April\\
Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,\\
Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,\\
I shall not care.\\
\\I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful\\
When rain bends down the bough,\\
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted\\
Than you are now.
\end{tabular}
