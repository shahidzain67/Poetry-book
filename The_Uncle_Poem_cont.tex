\begin{paracol}{3} % this is what I want
warm in the valley I wasn’t\\
there when my uncle died I\\
had picked up overtime\\
at the call center because\\
I needed money to buy\\
some oxycodone\\
for myself\\
I was planning to buy it\\
off of him tho obviously that\\
would be impossible because he is dead and\\
altho it doesn’t mean his pills are gone\\
it does mean it would be super
uncool to break into his trailer\\
and steal them I have\\
determined that he is the uncle I am referring to when I said\\
the skyscrapers were avuncular\\
tho referring isn’t the right word\\
I didn’t intend to call them avuncular\\
I felt it and it wouldn’t go away\\
like a dog bite\\
\switchcolumn[1]
but what made the skyscrapers\\
so avuncular my uncle had never been\\
to the city and possibly had never been\\
to any city he was country from his hair to the tip\\
of each toe he was so country that his countryness stretched\\ 
out from his body and into his car\\
maybe it’s because he never\\
saw these skyscrapers that I\\
think of him tho that\\
is bullshit and I know it so why the fuck\\
could I not push the avuncular\\
skyscrapers out of my decidedly\\
non-avuncular brain\\
was it the windows? the\\
black paneling?\\
maybe it isn’t the building at all\\
maybe it’s the idea of the building\\
and tho I don’t believe in ideas\\
I do believe in uncles\\
\switchcolumn[2]
maybe it is that the building
is so high it would take minutes to elevator up\\ %End of 3rd
and maybe an hour to climb\\
which means by the top you would be in\\
the future the real future the future minutes\\
away not seconds a future farther than\\
a word is from another word and maybe\\
because I look\\
at the skyscraper from the top down\\
I think of those elevators in reverse\\
which means I think of the future in reverse\\
and if those elevators go enough\\
the future will reverse enough to be the past\\
like the real past\\
like a few months ago when my\\
uncle was breathing and taking\\
pills and feeling the high\\
come on like television static\\
turning into tv or like tv\\
turning into television static
