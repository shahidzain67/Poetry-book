Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar\\
\indent \indent \indent \indent --Laurence Hope\\
\-\ \\Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight?\\
Whom else from rapture’s road will you expel tonight?\\
\-\ \\Those “Fabrics of Cashmere—” “to make Me beautiful—”\\
“Trinket”—to gem—“Me to adorn—How tell”—tonight?\\
\-\ \\I beg for haven: Prisons, let open your gates—\\
A refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight.\\
\-\ \\God’s vintage loneliness has turned to vinegar—\\
All the archangels—their wings frozen—fell tonight.\\
\-\ \\\emph{Lord}, cried out the idols, \emph{Don’t let us be broken;}\\
\emph{Only we can convert the infidel tonight.}\\
\-\ \\Mughal ceilings, let your mirrored convexities\\
multiply me at once under your spell tonight.}
\ParallelRText{\noindent
He’s freed some fire from ice in pity for Heaven.\\
He’s left open—for God—the doors of Hell tonight.\\ 
\-\ \\In the heart’s veined temple, all statues have been smashed.\\
No priest in saffron’s left to toll its knell tonight.\\
\-\ \\God, limit these punishments, there’s still Judgment Day—\\
I’m a mere sinner, I’m no infidel tonight.\\
\-\ \\Executioners near the woman at the window.\\
Damn you, Elijah, I’ll bless Jezebel tonight.\\
\-\ \\The hunt is over, and I hear the Call to Prayer\\
fade into that of the wounded gazelle tonight.\\
\-\ \\My rivals for your love—you’ve invited them all?\\
This is mere insult, this is no farewell tonight.\\
\-\ \\And I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee—\\
God sobs in my arms. Call me Ishmael tonight.}
