When I die\\
when my coffin\\
is being taken out\\
you must never think\\
i am missing this world\\ \-\ \\
don't shed any tears\\
don't lament or\\
feel sorry\\
i'm not falling\\
into a monster's abyss\\ \-\ \\
when you see\\
my corpse is being carried\\
don't cry for my leaving\\
i'm not leaving\\
i'm arriving at eternal love
\switchcolumn[1]
when you leave me\\
in the grave\\
don't say goodbye\\
remember a grave is\\
only a curtain\\
for the paradise behind\\ \-\ \\
you'll only see me\\
descending into a grave\\
now watch me rise\\
how can there be an end\\
when the sun sets or\\
the moon goes down\\ \-\ \\
it looks like the end\\
it seems like a sunset\\
but in reality it is a dawn\\
when the grave locks you up\\
that is when your soul is freed\\
\switchcolumn[2]
have you ever seen\\
a seed fallen to earth\\
not rise with a new life\\
why should you doubt the rise
of a seed named human\\ \-\ \\
have you ever seen\\
a bucket lowered into a well\\
coming back empty\\
why lament for a soul\\
when it can come back\\
like Joseph from the well\\ \-\ \\
when for the last time\\
you close your mouth\\
your words and soul\\
will belong to the world of\\
no place no time
