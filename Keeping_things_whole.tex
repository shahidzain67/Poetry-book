In a field\\
I am the absence\\
of field.\\
This is\\
always the case.\\
Wherever I am\\
I am what is missing.\\
\-\ \\When I walk\\
I part the air\\
and always\\
the air moves in\\
to fill the spaces\\
where my bodyâ€™s been.\\
\-\ \\We all have reasons\\
for moving.\\
I move\\
to keep things whole.
