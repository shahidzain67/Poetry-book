Mrs. Nelson explained how to stand still and listen\\
to the wind, how to find meaning in pumping gas,\\

\-\ \\how peeling potatoes can be a form of prayer. She took\\
questions on how not to feel lost in the dark\\

\-\ \\After lunch she distributed worksheets\\
that covered ways to remember your grandfather’s\\

\-\ \\voice. Then the class discussed falling asleep\\
without feeling you had forgotten to do something else—\\

\-\ \\something important—and how to believe\\

Mrs. Nelson to draw a chalkboard diagram detailing\\
how to chant the Psalms during cigarette breaks,\\

\-\ \\and how not to squirm for sound when your own thoughts\\
are all you hear; also, that you have enough.\\

\-\ \\The English lesson was that I am\\
is a complete sentence.\\

\-\ \\And just before the afternoon bell, she made the math equation\\
look easy. The one that proves that hundreds of questions,\\

\-\ \\and feeling cold, and all those nights spent looking\\
for whatever it was you lost, and one person\\
add up to something.}
